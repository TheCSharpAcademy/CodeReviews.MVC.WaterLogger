# Welcom to "Progress Tracker"

== Project Info ==
1- This Project was with ASP.NET and Razor pages.
2- Database: Sqlite and raw sql (No Entity Framework)
3- Language C# ðŸ˜…

== Program Flow ==
1- Make a progress to track which is a group of subtask that has 2 states completed or not.
2- Delete tasks
3- You can also update the state or titles of subtask or even name of main progress

== Hardships ==
1- Never done Frontend although know basic HTML and CSS. The JS code for create page was done with Chatgpt
2- Razor pages. The idea of using Html and C# in one file is astounding but back to same point I lack decent Frontend skills
3- Instead of having css files i wrote some style in the razor pages making it harder to refactor and had to rewrite some parts (Messy frontend code)

== Lessons ==
1- Must keep code Modular and Clean
2- I need to start enhancing my Frontend skills
3- Keep it short and simple. At the beginning I wanted to implement Lots of features and unlike the console projects There is more than just C# code so I had to remove some Features.

== Current Objectives ==
1- In coming projects I want to understand most of code I write and Not depend on Copying and pasting (except boilerplate)
2- Learn About Bootstrap and JS.

Thank you.
